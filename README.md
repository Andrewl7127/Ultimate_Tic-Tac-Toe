The Game of ULTIMATE TIC TAC TOE

The game consists of one GIANT tic tac toe board, where each square is filled with its own mini board.

The object of the game is to win the GIANT tic tac toe board.

Rules:

    To win: Get 3 GIANT squares in a row to win OR win more GIANT squares than your opponent.

    To draw: Neither player gets 3 GIANT squares in a row.

How to move: 

             On the first turn of the game, the first player can play anywhere.

             Excluding the first turn, you must play in the GIANT square that corresponds to the mini square that the
              previous player clicked on.
              
             If the GIANT square has been won/drawn, moves cannot be played in that square anymore.
             
             If the mini square clicked corresponds with a GIANT square that has been won/drawn, the next player can play
              in any square.
